# Audio Capture & Transcription Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

Audio capture with local Whisper transcription has been integrated into your Electron + React application!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Windows System Audio Limitations

**System audio capture in Electron/Windows has important limitations:**

### What Works:

- ‚úÖ **Microphone Recording**: Always works reliably
- ‚úÖ **Tab/Application Audio**: Can capture audio from Chrome tabs or specific application windows
- ‚úÖ **Local Transcription**: Whisper AI transcription works offline

### What Doesn't Work:

- ‚ùå **True System-Wide Audio Loopback**: Electron's `desktopCapturer` cannot capture all system audio
- ‚ùå **Background Audio**: Can only capture from the specific window/tab being captured
- ‚ùå **Mixed Audio Sources**: Cannot capture from multiple apps simultaneously

### Why?

Electron uses Chromium's screen capture API, which:

- Requires selecting a specific window/screen to capture
- Only captures audio that's part of that specific capture source
- Doesn't provide Windows WASAPI loopback access

### Alternative Solutions for True System Audio:

1. **Use VB-Audio Virtual Cable** (free software) to route system audio
2. **Enable "Stereo Mix"** in Windows Sound settings (if available)
3. **Use dedicated audio capture software** alongside this app
4. **Use microphone mode** to capture audio by playing it through speakers

## üöÄ How to Use

### Method 1: Microphone Recording (Recommended)

1. Select **"Microphone"** mode
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Speak into your microphone or play audio through speakers
4. Click "Stop Recording"
5. Wait for transcription

### Method 2: System Audio (Experimental)

1. Select **"System Audio (Experimental)"** mode
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. **Important**: Select the window/app that's playing audio
4. Make sure audio is actively playing from that source
5. Click "Stop Recording"
6. Wait for transcription

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Created:

- `src/type/audio.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions
- `src/components/AudioCapture/index.tsx` - React component
- `src/components/AudioCapture/audio-capture.css` - Styling
- `src/components/AudioCapture/README.md` - Component docs
- `AUDIO_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md` - This guide

### Modified:

- `electron/main/index.ts` - IPC handlers
- `electron/preload/index.ts` - Audio capture API
- `src/App.tsx` - Integrated component
- `package.json` - Added whisper-node

## ‚öôÔ∏è First-Time Setup

**On first use**, Whisper model (~75MB) downloads automatically:

- Requires internet (one-time only)
- Takes 1-2 minutes
- Cached locally forever
- After setup, works completely offline

## üîß Configuration

### Change Whisper Model

Edit `electron/main/index.ts` (around line 174):

```typescript
modelName: "base.en",  // Current setting
```

**Available models:**

- `tiny.en` - Fastest, lowest quality (~75MB)
- `base.en` - Balanced (default) (~75MB)
- `small.en` - Better quality (~244MB)
- `medium.en` - High quality (~769MB)
- `large` - Best quality, all languages (~1.5GB)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to start recording"

**Solutions:**

- Try microphone mode instead
- Check if you have a microphone connected
- Restart the application
- Check Windows audio permissions

### System audio mode crashes

**This is expected!** System audio capture is experimental and limited.
**Solution:** Use microphone mode for reliable operation.

### Empty or incorrect transcription

**Causes:**

- No audio was recorded
- Audio was too quiet
- Non-English audio with `base.en` model

**Solutions:**

- Make sure audio is loud enough
- Speak clearly into the microphone
- Use `large` model for non-English audio

### Transcription is slow

**This is normal!** Whisper is CPU-intensive.

**Optimization:**

- Use smaller model (`tiny.en`)
- Record shorter clips
- Close other programs
- Typical: ~10-30 seconds per minute of audio

### Model download fails

**Solutions:**

- Check internet connection
- Check firewall settings
- Try again (resumes automatically)

## üí° Recommended Setup for System Audio

If you need true system audio capture:

### Option 1: VB-Audio Virtual Cable (Free)

1. Download from https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
2. Install the virtual audio driver
3. Set it as default playback device
4. Use microphone mode and select the virtual cable as input

### Option 2: Stereo Mix (If Available)

1. Right-click speaker icon ‚Üí Sounds
2. Recording tab
3. Right-click ‚Üí Show Disabled Devices
4. Enable "Stereo Mix"
5. Set as default recording device
6. Use microphone mode

### Option 3: Play Through Speakers

1. Use microphone mode
2. Play audio through speakers
3. Microphone will capture it

## üîí Privacy & Security

- ‚úÖ All processing is local
- ‚úÖ No cloud services
- ‚úÖ No internet needed (after setup)
- ‚úÖ Audio files auto-deleted
- ‚úÖ Fully private

## üìù Performance

- **Recording**: ~1-2% CPU
- **Transcription**: 50-100% CPU (normal for AI)
- **Memory**: ~200-500MB during transcription
- **Speed**: ~10-30 seconds per minute of audio

## üéì Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements:

1. **Native WASAPI addon** for true Windows loopback
2. **Save transcripts** to file
3. **Audio playback** for reviewing
4. **Real-time transcription** while recording
5. **Multiple languages** with model switcher
6. **Timestamps** in transcript

### Why Not Implemented?

True system audio requires:

- Native C++ addon for Windows WASAPI
- Complex build configuration
- Platform-specific code
- More complexity than benefit for most users

**Current solution (microphone + VB-Cable) is simpler and more reliable!**

## üÜò Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Use microphone mode** - it's more reliable
2. Check console logs (Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Try the troubleshooting steps above
4. Consider VB-Audio Virtual Cable for system audio
