# Audio Capture Crash Fix - Summary

## What Was Wrong

The original implementation had several issues:

1. **Missing dependency**: `whisper-node` wasn't properly added to package.json
2. **Incorrect audio capture approach**: Tried to capture audio without video, which Electron's desktopCapturer doesn't support
3. **No fallback mechanism**: No error handling when system audio capture failed
4. **Unrealistic expectations**: The system audio "loopback" feature doesn't work as expected in Electron

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Whisper Dependency

- Properly added `whisper-node` to package.json dependencies
- This ensures the transcription library is available

### 2. Fixed Audio Capture Logic

- Added video track capture (required by Electron's desktopCapturer)
- Immediately stopped video tracks to only use audio
- Created proper audio-only MediaStream

### 3. Added Fallback to Microphone

- If system audio fails, automatically falls back to microphone
- Shows clear error message to user
- Provides graceful degradation

### 4. Added Mode Selector UI

- Users can now choose between:
  - **System Audio (Experimental)**: Tries to capture from windows/apps
  - **Microphone**: Reliable audio recording from mic
- Clear warning message about limitations

### 5. Improved Error Handling

- Better error messages
- Prevents crashes on permission denial
- Provides helpful feedback

## How to Use Now

### For Most Users (Recommended):

1. Select **"Microphone"** mode
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Speak or play audio through speakers
4. Click "Stop Recording"
5. Wait for transcription

### For System Audio (Limited):

1. Select **"System Audio"** mode
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. **Select the specific window playing audio**
4. Audio must be actively playing from that window
5. Click "Stop Recording"

### For TRUE System Audio (Best Solution):

1. Install [VB-Audio Virtual Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) (free)
2. Route your system audio through it
3. Use **Microphone mode** in the app
4. Select the virtual cable as input
5. Now you can capture ALL system audio!

## Why System Audio Is Limited

**Electron/Chromium Limitation:**

- `desktopCapturer` API is designed for screen recording
- Can only capture audio from the specific window/screen being recorded
- Cannot access Windows WASAPI loopback directly
- Not a bug - it's a platform limitation!

**For true system-wide audio capture**, you need:

- Native Windows WASAPI addon (requires C++)
- OR VB-Audio Virtual Cable (much simpler!)
- OR Windows "Stereo Mix" feature (if available)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the app:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Microphone Mode:**

   - Select "Microphone"
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Speak into your mic
   - Click "Stop Recording"
   - Should transcribe successfully!

3. **Test System Audio Mode:**
   - Select "System Audio (Experimental)"
   - Play audio (e.g., YouTube video)
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Select the window playing audio
   - Record for 10-20 seconds
   - Click "Stop Recording"
   - May work depending on source

## Summary

✅ **Fixed crashes** - App no longer crashes when starting recording
✅ **Added microphone mode** - Reliable audio capture method
✅ **Better error handling** - Clear messages when things go wrong
✅ **Improved UI** - Mode selector and warnings
⚠️ **System audio is limited** - Use VB-Cable for true system capture

**Bottom Line:** Use Microphone mode for reliable operation, or install VB-Audio Virtual Cable for true system audio capture!
